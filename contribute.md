## Bug Reports
As any software product, Boost may comes with bugs and we appreciate your help in finding them. If you want to file a bug report, head over to the related repository and create a new issue. Please provide a clear title and description, steps to reproduce and as many details as possible.

A way to report a bug is sending a failing test that outlines the problem. Even better: open a pull request that solves the the bug.

Boost’s source code is managed and hosted on GitLab:

- [Boost Framework](https://gitlab.com/futurestudio-boost/boost)
- [Boost Docs](https://gitlab.com/futurestudio-boost/docs)


## Coding Style
Boost follows the [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) JavaScript code style. There’s an `.eslintrc` file in Boost’s root directory which contains the linter configuration. We highly recommend to use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure a consistent coding style in your project.
