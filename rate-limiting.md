# Rate Limiting


## Introduction
Rate limiting protects your application against brute-force attacks. Supercharge doesn’t include rate limiting by default. We created a Supercharge-compatible plugin called [hapi-rate-limitor](https://github.com/fs-opensource/hapi-rate-limitor) that makes it easy for you add this feature into your application.

The hapi-rate-limitor plugin uses [Redis](https://redis.io) to store rate-limit related data.

Find more details on how to [install and use the plugin in the GitHub repository’s README](https://github.com/futurestudio/hapi-rate-limitor).
